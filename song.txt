I'm the serpent
Devil's servant
Time to meet your end

Fangs are ready for the strike
Deadly razor sharp
Poison with a single spike
When they rip apart
Screaming like a maniac
After my attack
Crying like a baby child
In exile

Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling til youre dead.
